# Team Profile

`Team Profile` shows information about integrating `PPCom`, developing `third party Kefu and Console`.

---------

#### Team UUID / App UUID

`Team uuid` (also called `app_uuid`) is your service team's uuid. You will need it when you integrate `PPCom` with your website and invoke `PPMessage`'s APIs.


#### Team Name

You can change your service team name here.


#### Third Party App

`PPKefu api_key`, `PPKefu api_sercret` are for `Third Party Kefu`.

`PPConsole api_key`, `PPConsole api_secret` are for `Third Party Console`.

To Develop your third party app (invoke `PPMessage`'s APIs), you need to get a token using `api_key` and `api_secret`.

For more details, please check [third party app](../third-party-app.md).
