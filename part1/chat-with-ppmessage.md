# Chat With PPMessage's Service Agents

In [ppmessage.com](https://ppmessage.com), you can chat with PPMessage's service agents via `PPCom`. 

---

#### Try `PPCom` 

1. Open [ppmessage.com](https://ppmessage.com). You will see a floating icon (called `PPCom`) in right bottom corner of the website. Move your mouse over `PPCom`, it will show a `Start Chat` card with welcome note.

2. Click `PPCom`, it will open a chat window. You can type words in the text area below the chat window and send message to our service agents by typing `Enter`.

3. Our service agents should have received your message and give you a reply by now. Apart from text message, you can also send image, file and emoji message via `PPCom`. 

4. Whatever questions you have when using `PPMessage`, you can come here and ask us. 


#### Integrate `PPCom`

Your website can also have a `PPCom`, just like [ppmessage.com](https://ppmessage.com). All you have to do is register an account in [ppmessage.com](https://ppmessage.com) and insert a line of code into the source file of your website.

You can find more details in [Deploy PPMessage](../part2/README.md).
